    <h2>Description</h2>
    
    <p>Great brunch item and has many ways to customize this with 
        egg styles and flavors to add.</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    
    <ul>
        
        <li>cooking spray</li>
        
        <li>12 slices bacon</li>
        
        <li>10 eggs</li>
        
        <li>1/4 cup milk</li>
        
        <li>1/4 cup diced jalapeno pepper</li>
        
        <li>1/4 cup diced roasted red pepper</li>
        
        <li>1 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        
        <li>1/2 cup shredded Cheddar cheese</li>
    
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        
        <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Prepare 
            12 muffin cups with cooking spray.</li>
        
        <li>Arrange bacon on a microwave-safe plate. Cook bacon in 
            microwave for 75 seconds.</li>
        
        <li>Place a slice of bacon into each muffin cup so that the 
            bacon lines the edges of the cup.</li>
        
        <li>Beat eggs and milk together in a bowl; ladle into muffin 
            cups. Top 4 of the egg portions with 1 tablespoon each of 
            the green onion, 4 with 1 tablespoon each jalapeno pepper, 
            and 4 each with 1 tablespoon roasted red pepper.</li>

        <li>Bake in preheated oven until only slightly moist on top, 
            about 20 minutes. Season the muffins with salt and pepper; 
            top with Cheddar cheese. Continue baking until the cheese melts, 
            about 5 minutes more.</li>
    
    </ol>
