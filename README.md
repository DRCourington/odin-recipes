# odin-recipes

In this project I will have created a basic
html website using all of the skills covered
in the Odin Projects' HTML foundations section.
Which include:
    - Creating the HTML format from scratch
    - Ensuring proper formatting for
      accessability with screen readers and
      google searching.
    - Using proper encryption so page can be
      viewed everywhere.
    - Including paragraphs, headers and
      images to show source knowledge.
    - Bold and Italicized text used to
      improve accessability more.
    - Links used to get to other pages
      on host machine as well as other 
      websites.
